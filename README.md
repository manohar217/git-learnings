---------------------
1.git init : When you're inside a directory that you've cloned from a Git repository, you don't need to run git init. Git already knows it's a repository because you've cloned it. You can start tracking and managing files right away.

However, if you're in a directory that isn't part of a Git repository, you have to tell Git to start tracking those files by running git init. It's like telling Git, "Hey, I want you to keep an eye on these files and their changes from now on."
